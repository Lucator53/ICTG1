        <h2>History</h2>
       <p>Unveiled in 2014 to coincide with the Palarong Pambansa held in Laguna that year, the Jose Rizal Monument at the Laguna Sports Complex offers a unique tribute to the national hero.  Standing tall at 7.9 meters, it's the Philippines' highest Rizal statue, but more importantly, it depicts him not as a scholar or writer, but as a fencer,  highlighting his lesser-known athletic prowess and aiming to inspire a more well-rounded view of Dr. Jose Rizal.</p>
